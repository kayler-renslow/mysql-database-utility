-fixed bug when sync couldnt occur because the table had no primary keys. now if there are now primary keys, it will delete everywhere where all the values match
-moved view edits stuff out of the ViewEditsWindow class and into it's own class so that it can be injected in other windows
-when syncing, a confirmation popup showing all edits appears asking for confirmation of the sync
-new entry now makes all the fields empty instead of putting a space or placeholder text
-now can refresh tab's tableview's data
